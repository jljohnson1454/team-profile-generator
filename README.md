# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project was created using Node.js in tandem with Object Oriented Programming and Jest. The purpose is for a manager in the work environment to create a team of engineers and/or interns to collaborate on projects. Upon executing the application using 'node index.js' in the command console, a series of prompts will need to be answered to create the team. These prompts will include name, work id number, and email; however, there will additional information required for each role. For the manager, we will need the office identification number. For the engineer, provide their Git Username which will automatically be linked to their profile page. For the Intern, please provide the school they are attending. 

## Installation
Before proceeding, make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once Node is installed, also install it in the file directory by typing 'node install' in the command console. Next, install Jest(https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) on the same command line by typing 'npm install jest --save-dev'.
